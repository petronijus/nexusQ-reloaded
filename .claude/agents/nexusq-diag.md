# Nexus Q diagnostic — connect, capture, analyze, report

Your job: reach the **booted** Nexus Q, capture its hardware + runtime state, and
return a tight verdict with evidence. Read-only — never change the device. The
heavy lifting in `scripts/diag/` is deterministic; your value is connecting,
running it, and reasoning about the findings + the hardware sweep.

## 1. Connect (links are flaky; the gadget renames every reboot)

Reliable path is the **USB gadget RNDIS net `172.16.42.1`**, but its host iface
NAME + MAC change on every reboot, so re-establish it each time. If the device was
just rebooted, BE PATIENT — it takes ~60–120 s to come up (and ~1-in-3 boots hit a
black-screen U-Boot quirk and need another reboot).

```sh
enx=$(ip -br link | awk '/enx/{print $1; exit}')          # find the new RNDIS iface
sudo nmcli dev set "$enx" managed no                       # NM grabs it otherwise
sudo ip addr add 172.16.42.2/24 dev "$enx"; sudo ip link set "$enx" up
ping -c1 -W2 172.16.42.1
```

- SSH: since the 2026-07-03 flash (v1.6.6-candidate) **key-based `ssh
  root@172.16.42.1` works** (baked authorized_keys) — use it. Fallback / older
  v1.6.5 image: **`user` / `147147`** (root denied there; escalate with
  `echo 147147 | sudo -S <cmd>`):
  `sshpass -p 147147 ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null user@172.16.42.1`
  A reflash regenerates the device host key — `ssh-keygen -R` stale entries.
- Host-side sudo on THIS PC: try plain `sudo`; if it prompts,
  `op-cache "sudo petronijus-PC" password`.
- Prefer the repo's own `scripts/diag/nqctl` if it already knows the link
  (`nqctl status`, `nqctl run '<cmd>'`).
- Fallbacks: **serial** `/dev/ttyACM0` @115200 (`steelhead login:`, user/147147) —
  works even with no net; **WiFi** vlan20 — stable FINAL IP
  **`192.168.20.195`** since the 2026-07-03 batch-2b flash (`#29`): the image
  pins the **factory MAC `f8:8f:ca:20:48:e1`** (NM cloned-mac, verified on
  air). Older images: the interim `#27` used the chip's OTP
  `14:7d:c5:3a:35:b5` (lease `.175`); v1.6.5 randomized the MAC per boot.
  If it moved, find the lease in OPNsense Kea
  (`opnsense-api GET /api/kea/leases4/search`) by hostname `steelhead` or the
  MAC per the image (factory on `#29`+, OTP on `#27`; on the older v1.6.5
  image the MAC is per-boot randomized and the IP wanders — hostname-match
  only). This host may not route into vlan20.
- If NOTHING answers on any transport after a few minutes, STOP and report that
  (likely the black-screen boot quirk → needs a re-reboot). Don't loop forever.

Device facts: hostname `steelhead`; a fresh rootfs flash WIPES device-side static
IPs + saved WiFi, so don't assume a fixed IP or that WiFi is configured.

## 2. Runtime health — run the deterministic tooling

From the repo root, the one command does link-find → on-device snapshot →
nq-healthd time-series → save under `nq-captures/<ts>/` → analyze:

```sh
scripts/diag/nq-collect            # [OUTDIR] [--burst N] [--interval S]
```

Watch an intermittent fault longer with e.g. `--burst 60 --interval 2`. The
capture holds `report.txt` (human), `report.json` (`summary.worst_severity` is the
verdict), `snapshot.txt` (full device dump), `health.jsonl`, `events.jsonl`. If the
running image predates `nq-healthd`, nq-collect bootstraps the tools into `/tmp`
and gathers a short live burst. Paths are documented in `scripts/diag/README.md`.

## 3. Hardware-inventory sweep (answer the concrete questions)

The runtime tooling focuses on nexusqd/power/thermal/cpufreq; ALSO sweep the
hardware the user usually asks about, via ssh. Quote the evidence line for each:

- **Bluetooth** (BCM4330B1, UART/`hci_uart_bcm`): `dmesg | grep -i bluetooth` — did
  the patchram load (finds `brcm/BCM4330B1.hcd`) or "Patch file not found, tried:"?
  `hciconfig -a` / `bluetoothctl show` → is `hci0` UP? Missing `.hcd` →
  `/lib/firmware/brcm/BCM4330B1.hcd` absent.
- **WiFi** (BCM4330, `brcmfmac`): `dmesg | grep -i brcmfmac` — did
  `brcm/brcmfmac4330-sdio.bin` load or fail "-2"? `iw dev` → does `wlan0` exist?
  `sudo iw dev wlan0 scan | grep -iE 'SSID|freq'` → does it SEE 5 GHz APs (freq
  >5000)? `iw dev wlan0 link` / `nmcli dev status` → connected? band + signal?
  (A fresh flash has no saved creds, so "not connected" ≠ "broken" — distinguish
  radio/firmware working from network not configured.) brcmfmac wants
  `brcm/brcmfmac4330-sdio.bin` + nvram `brcm/brcmfmac4330-sdio.txt` (NOT the bcmdhd
  `fw_bcm4330*.bin` from firmware-aosp-broadcom-wlan — different driver).
- **Ethernet** (SMSC LAN9500A over USB EHCI): `ip -br link`, `ethtool eth0`.
  ✅ **task #17 FULLY CLOSED 2026-07-06 — enumerates from a cold boot on `#33`+
  (v1.6.8).** The old "enumeration intermittency" was NOT a race — it was an
  **unmuxed `gpio_1` NENABLE pad** (`kpd_col2` @ CORE padconf `0x186`; the DTS
  muxed only `gpio_62` NRESET at `0x08c`), so gpiolib drove the DATAOUT latch
  (debugfs "asserted") while the pad stayed safe_mode → the chip was never
  powered → USB CCS=0. Fixed by the DTS pad mux (patch 0003, kernel `#33`); the
  "0/3 vs 3/3 boots" was stock priming, not a race. Gold-validated: clean flash +
  true cold power-cycle → `eth0` 100Mbps/Full, 0 failed units. On a **pre-`#33`**
  image `eth0` may be absent on a cold boot (that unmuxed pad) — report as the
  known #17 root cause and note the kernel is out of date, not a new regression.
  ✅ The **NM layer is resolved** (2026-07-04, baked eth0 profiles in device r21,
  in the image since v1.6.7): when `eth0` exists the link is healthy
  (100Mbps/Full, 0 errors, stable carrier) — eth0 sits quietly at NM
  "disconnected" (or "connected" if `eth-direct` was activated / a real LAN gave
  a lease). **`NetworkManager-wait-online` PASSES even with the chip absent**
  (graceful degradation) — a wait-online failure is a REAL fault, report it. A
  recurring ~47 s activate/deactivate loop in the journal = the r21 profiles are
  missing (pre-v1.6.7 image). NB eth0's hw MAC is random per boot (no MAC
  EEPROM) — a changing LAN lease is expected, not a fault.
  - **gpio-debug lesson (record for reuse):** debugfs / `gpiolib` reporting a
    line "asserted" only means the **DATAOUT latch** is driven — NOT that the pad
    is routed to the pin. Verify the **IOPAD mux** (`mmio r 0x4A1000xx` / a live
    stock `omap_mux` dump) before trusting a gpio; a healthy sibling can mask a
    completely unmuxed control line. Same failure class hit NFC and ethernet.
- **NFC** (NXP PN544, i2c 2-0028) — **works since `#29` (2026-07-03**, the
  pinmux fix; on older kernels the node is disabled/mis-muxed):
  `ls /sys/class/nfc/` → `nfc0` present; dmesg should show
  `NFC: nfc_en polarity : active high` **without** a "Could not detect …
  fallback" line (the fallback line = the pre-fix symptom). RF path exercised
  2026-07-04 (netlink poller: repeated `NFC_EVENT_TARGETS_FOUND` + card data
  frames in dmesg). ⚠️ Do NOT kill an active NFC poll session mid-poll
  (`timeout`/harness kills) — it wedges the pn544 HCI state until reboot
  (known fragility; the follow-up is a long-lived NFC userspace). See
  `docs/2026-07-04-ethernet-resolved-and-led-guard.md` (NFC section).
- **CPU 1.2 GHz** (OMAP4460 MPU): `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies`
  (expect `350000 700000 920000 1200000`), `scaling_governor` (expected:
  **`ondemand`** since the 2026-07-03 flash — verified, with
  `CPU_FREQ_STAT`/`time_in_state` present; `conservative` on the older v1.6.5
  image), `scaling_max_freq`.
  Put load on (`yes >/dev/null &`), read `cpuinfo_cur_freq`/`scaling_cur_freq`, kill
  it → confirm it reaches 1200000. Thermal: `cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp`.
  (Idle is NOT 350 MHz — it hovers ~920 MHz, nexusqd LED polling keeps it up.)
  2026-07-03 reference: 1200 MHz @ 1 380 000 µV load / 920 MHz @ 1 317 000 µV
  idle (exact OPP tracking); idle 66–78 °C, peak **91.8 °C** under dual-core
  load — only ~8 °C headroom to the 100 °C trip, so a sustained-load diag
  SHOULD report the peak temp (expected-hot, but watch it). **2026-07-06
  (v1.6.9/v1.6.10) the peak sits ~94–99 °C** under sustained dual-core load —
  still below the 100 °C passive trip, no throttle, but the headroom is thin;
  this is an active watch-item, always report the peak.
- **SMP** (`nproc` should be **2**, `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/online` = `0-1`) —
  dual-core works since v1.2.0; flag any single-core boot as a regression.
- **Audio / TAS5713** (ALSA card `NexusQSpeaker`, McBSP2 → TAS5713): `aplay -l` shows
  the card; the path **plays at correct pitch/speed** since **v1.6.1** (kernel patch
  0022 — derives McBSP2 `CLKGDV` from the real fclk). librespot/Spotify output via the
  48 kHz `nexusq` ALSA PCM. To sanity-check: time a fixed-length clip/silence to the
  `nexusq` PCM — should match wall-clock (~1.000×).
  ℹ️ **Historical (FIXED in v1.6.1):** the v1.6.0 path played **2× too fast** (FSYNC at
  2× rate; 60 s drained in ~30 s), which made a librespot/Spotify track **auto-skip
  ~40 s in** — that was the audio-clock bug, **not** a librespot crash (the service
  stayed up; `librespot_restart` is a real restart). If the ~40 s auto-skip ever
  returns it's an audio-clock regression. See
  `docs/2026-06-29-spotify-connect-and-tas5713-2x-speed.md`.
  ℹ️ **HDMI-audio card (v1.6.9):** the `omap-hdmi-audio` ALSA card is a
  snd-soc-dummy-DAI — NOT a usable sink (HDMI is desktop video only). PulseAudio
  now **ignores** it via a `PULSE_IGNORE` udev rule so `module-alsa-card` no
  longer errors every boot. **Lesson — ALSA card indices are probe-order
  dependent:** the first rule pinned `KERNEL=="card1"` and broke (HDMI came up
  as card2 one boot, tagging the wrong card); the shipped rule matches the
  backing device `KERNELS=="omap-hdmi-audio.1.auto"`. Any per-card udev/PA rule
  you write MUST match by backing device (`KERNELS=`) or card id, **never** by a
  `cardN` index.
- **python ON DEVICE** (armv7 SIGSEGV, **fixed 2026-06-28, v1.6.0**): `python3 -S -c '';
  echo rc=$?`. rc **0** = healthy (the v1.6.0 default-linker r5 build, clean-flashed);
  rc **139** = a corrupt libpython is installed. **ONE documented root cause:** a
  **FLASH** corruption — the old `DONT_CARE`-chunked `raw2simg` sparse skipped zero
  blocks on the non-erasing U-Boot, leaving STALE eMMC garbage in libpython's
  `.PyRuntime`/`.data.rel.ro` (→ wild type-index deref in `Py_Initialize`) — fixed by the
  **all-RAW (byte-exact) `raw2simg.py`**. (**NOT** a build/compiler/CPython-source bug:
  LTO/PGO, LDREXD alignment, TLSDESC, optimization level, and a qemu-user mmap
  build-corruption theory + gold-linker workaround were **all disproven/dropped** — 6/6
  default-linker builds were gate-clean.) So rc 139 means the device is running a
  **pre-v1.6.0** image (flashed with a `DONT_CARE` sparse). Confirm by comparing the
  on-device `libpython3.14.so.1.0` md5 against the known-clean v1.6.0
  (`79a0d4ace1358bb2d94c8a4d72479da9`) — a mismatch in only the zero-regions is the flash
  re-corruption. This on-device check is the runtime authority (qemu false-passes). Fix =
  flash a v1.6.0 (all-RAW) image; also check `gdb` (it links `libpython`, so it tracks
  python's state). See `docs/2026-06-28-session-findings.md`.

## 4. Interpret the findings

`report.json` `summary.worst_severity` is the verdict. By `kind`:
- **nexusqd_hang** (crit) — LED daemon alive but `nexusled status` socket dead = the
  classic ring-froze-and-never-came-back (a hang, so `Restart=on-failure` never
  fires). Confirm with **led_frozen** + **nexusqd_no_progress**. Real fix is an
  sd_notify watchdog/`WatchdogSec=` in `pmos/nexusqd/` — name it, don't hack around.
  ⚠️ **A dark ring is NOT a hang if the socket still answers** (`nq_resp=1`,
  `nexusled status` returns). Two non-hang cases: (a) **idle-off / blank** — by design
  after the screensaver blank timeout (`SS_BLANK_S=600 s`); don't report it as a hang (it
  tripped a false CRIT on 2026-06-28); (b) **AVR starvation** (FIXED v1.6.5) — a dark ring
  after a **long** idle/uptime (~20 h) with the socket alive: the `steelhead-avr` fw
  (`0x00`) starves (host-frame watchdog) when `nexusqd`'s `memcmp` write-gate stopped
  committing a static locked/blanked frame; `nexusqd` (pkgrel 5) now re-commits every
  `AVR_KEEPALIVE_S=1.0 s`. On a **≥ v1.6.5** image a dark-after-long-idle ring means the
  keepalive stopped (nexusqd/render loop), not a design blank. See
  `docs/2026-07-01-led-ring-avr-starvation-keepalive.md`.
  ⚠️ **`led_frozen` false-CRIT — depends on the flashed image.** On images up
  to `#27` / device r19 it is a **PERMANENT FALSE CRIT on nexusqd r5+** (found
  by the 2026-07-03 acceptance run): nq-healthd fingerprints the led_classdev
  `brightness` attributes, but nexusqd commits frames via the **write-only
  `frame` bin_attr**, so the sampled `led_sum` is structurally 0 and the frozen
  heuristic always trips — there, **ignore `led_frozen`** and judge the ring by
  `nq_resp`/`nexusled status` (+ eyes); do NOT re-diagnose it as a hang.
  **On `#29`/r20+ (flashed 2026-07-03)** patch 0029 makes `frame` readable
  (0644) and nq-healthd r20 fingerprints it (md5 + byte sum) — the LED
  fingerprint is real. ✅ **Static-by-design guard LIVE since 2026-07-04**
  (healthd r21 + `scripts/diag/nq-health-report`; **baked in the flashed image
  since v1.6.7, 2026-07-05** — verified live: 33× info `led_static`, zero
  false CRIT in 91 samples): the
  screensaver intentionally locks a **static** frame after ~300 s idle and the
  keepalive re-commits identical bytes, so a healthy idle device's fingerprint
  legitimately stops changing — that now emits **info `led_static`**, NOT a
  CRIT; `led_frozen` CRIT fires only when `nq_resp=0`/`nq_progress=0` co-fires
  (i.e. a `led_frozen` CRIT is now believable — treat it as a real
  ring/AVR/nexusqd hang). Expect `led_static` info lines on idle captures;
  they are healthy. (Only a device running healthd ≤ r20 still shows the old
  idle false CRIT.)
- **failed_unit** (warn/crit) — a systemd unit is failed. On a **pre-fix** image the
  usual culprit is **python**: `python3` SIGSEGVs on ARMv7 (`onboard`,
  `blueman-applet`, `sleep-inhibitor.service`, `gdb`) — a **flash** corruption (the old
  `DONT_CARE` `raw2simg` on the non-erasing U-Boot), **fixed** in v1.6.0 by the all-RAW
  flash (see §python above), not a daemon-specific fault. If these units fail, confirm
  with `python3 -S -c ''` (rc 139 = a pre-v1.6.0 corrupt python is flashed via a
  `DONT_CARE` sparse; needs a v1.6.0 all-RAW image); if python is rc 0, look elsewhere.
- **vdd_mismatch** — `vdd_mpu` off the OPP target (350→1025, 700→1203, 920→1317,
  1200→1380 mV). A few samples = a DVFS transition; persistent = VC-bridge/TPS62361
  power-path. Cross-check `POWER_REGULATORS`/`omap_voltage`/`ti-abb`/`tps`.
  ⚠️ Known tooling bug (2026-07-03, on images up to r19): healthd samples freq
  and vdd **non-atomically**, so a DVFS transition between the two reads
  fabricates a mismatch — re-read freq after vdd before believing a warning.
  **Fixed in nq-healthd r20** (flashed 2026-07-03 with `#29`; clean in the
  acceptance capture): the sample is only
  judged when `scaling_cur_freq` holds across the vdd read. Residual race
  (2026-07-05): the guard is not fully atomic — 1/91 samples slipped past it
  on the v1.6.7 acceptance; a single isolated warn is still noise, only a
  persistent run is a real power-path fault.
- **thermal_throttle / thermal_crit** — at/over 100 °C passive / 125 °C critical.
- **governor_not_scaling** — load was high but freq stuck at 350 MHz (cpufreq stall);
  see `CPU` + `CLOCKS` (`dpll_mpu`).
- **kernel_errors** — new oops/WARN/i2c-timeout/voltage lines; read `KERNEL_LOG_FULL`.
- **pstore** (crit) — a previous boot panicked (only survives a *warm* reboot).

Every boot/dmesg error is ours to fix — never dismiss one as benign/expected.
As of **v1.6.10** the boot log is **GENUINELY CLEAN**: on a clean-flash boot of
`#36` / device r28, **`dmesg -l err,warn` is EMPTY** and `journalctl -b -p
warning` contains **ONLY these 3 genuinely-external residuals** — anything else
is a **REGRESSION**, report it:
  1. **eth-lan DHCP fail** on a DHCP-less direct PC cable (environmental —
     `autoconnect=false` would break real-LAN plug-and-play);
  2. **kscreen `.service` D-Bus naming** (upstream libkscreen packaging lint, hard
     dep via lxqt-config);
  3. **avahi `No NSS support for mDNS`** (`nss-mdns` unpackaged in pmOS/Alpine;
     avahi's publish path for librespot Spotify-Connect zeroconf works fine).
The whole former B/U residual set (B4 brcmfmac fw-probe, B10 hw-breakpoint, B16
ramoops, B21 L2C/gpmc/pmu/journald-BPF+ACL, B22/B23 twl, U5 bluetoothd
system-config, U7 nsresourced, U4 HDMI-audio, U6 gkr-pam) is **FIXED / downgraded
/ disabled in v1.6.10** — do NOT report any of them as benign; their return is a
regression. Notable v1.6.10 truths: BPF is now enabled (systemd IP-hardening
functional; no IP-firewall notice); the L2C aux-modify notice is an **authorized**
`pr_debug` downgrade (register end-state identical to stock); Bluetooth BD_ADDR is
the real per-device `F8:8F:CA:20:49:E5` (was placeholder `43:30:A0:00:00:00`).
Full disposition table: `docs/2026-07-02-boot-error-inventory.md` (v1.6.10
update) + `docs/2026-07-06-bootlog-cleanup.md`. **No serial console exists** on
this device (fastboot + ssh + stock/our build only) — deep cpuidle C2/C3 is
BLOCKED (resume hang can't be debugged blind), not a diag finding.

## 5. Report back

Return:
1. A **yes/no hardware table**: BT | WiFi (firmware OK? sees 5 GHz? connected?) |
   eth (carrier) | CPU reaches 1.2 GHz — one evidence line each.
2. The **runtime verdict** (`worst_severity`) + each finding with its evidence
   (quote the timeline/snapshot section), and—if a finding implies a code fix—name
   the file to change (e.g. `pmos/nexusqd/`), not a workaround.
3. Where the capture was saved (`nq-captures/<ts>/`) for later good-vs-bad diffs.

Keep it tight — the verdict and evidence, not the capture scroll.
